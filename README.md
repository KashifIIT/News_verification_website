Hello, My name is Mohd. Kashif, a first year student Pursuing B.Tech. in Mechanical engineering
from IIT ISM Dhanbad, here above codes can be used to open my website which is on News verification 
platform where any user can post news (with detailing), read it, react to it, and vote 
on it as Fake or Real in a very effective way. I'd created this website as a part of
recruitment process for Blockchain division of Cyberlabs in my college.

Now, How to open my website using above files?


Step-1: Open in-built terminal of your PC.

Step-2: Run this code - git clone https://github.com/KashifIIT/News_verification_website.

Step-3: Now either it will start fetching files from github to your local computer or either it'll show some error like something which
will be like something is not downloaded in your computer. Therefore, if error come, firstly go to this website - git-scm.com - and download it, after downloading it, it'll open a pop-up, don't do any changes in default set-up, just keep clicking Ok -> Ok -> ..., until finally it reaches to finally start downloading it. After successful completion of the downloading process, again run that same code in Terminal, this time most probably it'll run.

Step-4: After successful completion of downloading process, run this - cd News_verification_website - It'll enter you to file name - News_verification_website - which is the name of Main folder of all files which you'd just downloaded.

Step-5: Run - cd Main_Page - it'll take to you the folder named "Main_Page" saved in "News_verification_website" folder.

Step-6: Run - start index.html - it'll run HTML file of my main page and from there by signing up, you can see all the features.

I hope so you will find my website to be Ok looking with decent functionalities, i will definitely try to improve
it's design and functionalities further more. In my website, there is also option for giving feedback and hence i will wait
for your feedbacks too. : )

Additional information - 

1. As i may do some changes, so for accessing the latest changes (only for those who'd already downloaded files of my website), always first run this after getting into "News_verification_website" folder - git pull origin main - it'll downloaded all the latest changes. Now if it'll show like "fatal error", then try run it again n again until it'll finally update all the files. ( Probably it'll run in 2nd or 3rd time if your internet connection is good.). If it'll show - Already up to date. - then it means i hadn't done any chnages.

2. If you want to go back in Terminal like from "Main_Page" to "News_verification_website", then run - cd .. - to go back.

I hope so you finds this document helpful. Thanks for reading.
